# Frontend Aesthetics

Avoid "AI slop" UI. Be opinionated + distinctive.

## Design Thinking (before coding)

- **Purpose**: What problem does this solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: Pick a direction — brutalist, maximalist, retro-futuristic, editorial, organic, luxury, playful, industrial, etc. Commit fully.
- **Differentiation**: What's the one memorable thing?
- **Execution**: Match complexity to vision. Maximalist = elaborate. Minimal = precise restraint.

## Aesthetics

- **Typography**: Distinctive, characterful fonts. Pair display + body. Never Inter/Roboto/Arial/system defaults.
- **Color**: Commit to a palette; CSS vars for consistency. Dominant color + sharp accents > evenly-distributed pastels.
- **Motion**: 1-2 high-impact moments. Staggered reveals on load > scattered micro-interactions. Scroll-triggered + hover surprises.
- **Spatial**: Unexpected layouts. Asymmetry, overlap, grid-breaking, generous negative space OR controlled density.
- **Backgrounds**: Depth, not flat. Gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, grain overlays, layered transparencies.

## Anti-patterns

Never: purple-on-white, generic component grids, predictable layouts, cookie-cutter structure. Vary themes/fonts/aesthetics across projects — never converge on common choices.
