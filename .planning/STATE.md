## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 3
- Average duration: 6min
- Total execution time: 0.3 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-foundation | 2 | 14min | 7min |
| 02-renderers-secrets | 1 | 2min | 2min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 6min, 8min, 2min

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Ported vsync ErrorSeverity/SyncError pattern with operation+path context
- hashFile uses raw bytes — diverges from vsync's model-level hashing
- atomicWrite ported from vsync with backup-first addition
- Format parsers are pure string-in/string-out (no file I/O)
- JSONC comment preservation via jsonc-parser modify+applyEdits
- smol-toml over @iarna/toml (TOML 1.1, smaller)
- Missing .env warns and continues (does not throw)
- EnvVarTransformer normalizes through claude-code format as intermediate
- codex env var format: strips ${} wrapper to bare var name
- gemini format identical to claude-code (${VAR})
- AdapterPathResolver fully expands ~ at construction time
- Claude command naming: strip zz- prefix, nest under zz/ subdir

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Research flags Phase 2 (Codex adapter) as least battle-tested — validate during implementation
- TOML comment preservation not supported by any JS library — current approach (generate from scratch) is fine for v1
