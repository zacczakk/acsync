# v2.0 Milestone Audit: Simplify Canonical

**Audited:** 2026-02-25T06:40:00Z
**Status:** ✅ PASSED
**Milestone Goal:** Flatten canonical structure, unify instructions, rename repo — breaking changes for cleaner architecture.

## Executive Summary

The v2.0 milestone is **complete**. All 24 requirements are satisfied, all 3 phases (6, 7, 8) are formally verified, all 4 E2E flows pass, and 402/402 tests are green. Phase 9 closed all process gaps: 08-VERIFICATION.md was created with 9/9 PASS attestation, REQUIREMENTS.md traceability is complete, and stale path references in living docs have been cleaned.

## Scores

| Category | Score | Detail |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Requirements | 24/24 satisfied | All requirements verified and checked off |
| Phases | 3/3 verified | Phase 6 passed, Phase 7 passed, Phase 8 passed |
| Integration | 24/24 wired | All cross-phase connections verified in code |
| E2E Flows | 4/4 pass | check, push, render, diff all work from any cwd |

## Phase Verification Summary

| Phase | Status | Score | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|-------|
| 6. Flatten Canonical Structure | passed | 5/5 | Re-verified after gap closure |
| 7. Unify Instructions | passed | 7/7 | Clean first-pass verification |
| 8. TOOLS.md + Repo Rename | passed | 9/9 | Verified in Phase 9 (08-VERIFICATION.md) |

## Integration Checker Results

**Score: 24/24 requirements verified as WIRED in codebase**

### Cross-Phase Wiring (5/5 WIRED)

| Integration Point | Status | Key Evidence |
|-------------------|--------|--------------|
| Phase 6 → Phase 7: Path constants → Instructions pipeline | WIRED | `INSTRUCTIONS_DIR` used by `readCanonicalInstructions`, imported by all 4 CLI commands |
| Phase 7 → Phase 8: Unified AGENTS.md → Repo rename paths | WIRED | Zero stale repo refs in source; all targets show `~/Repos/acsync` |
| Phase 6+7+8 → CLI: Full pipeline chain | WIRED | PROJECT_ROOT → path constants → readCanonical* → render → write; zero residual `cwd()` |
| Phase 8: PROJECT_ROOT bun link resolution | WIRED | `import.meta.dir` resolves correctly; `acsync check` works from /tmp |
| Phase 8: Settings sync (opencode.json) | WIRED | Both canonical and target show `instructions: ["~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md"]` |

### E2E Flows (4/4 PASS)

| Flow | Status | Evidence |
|------|--------|----------|
| `acsync check` from any directory | PASS | 54 items shown, correct drift detection |
| `acsync push --force` renders all configs | PASS | Full pipeline: read → render → atomicWrite → manifest |
| `acsync push --type instructions` writes correct files | PASS | CLAUDE.md + AGENTS.md×3 at correct paths; stale files absent |
| `acsync render --type instruction` outputs content | PASS | Identity passthrough confirmed |

## Tech Debt (Resolved)

### Phase 8: TOOLS.md + Repo Rename
- ~~Missing 08-VERIFICATION.md~~ — **RESOLVED**: Created in Phase 9 Plan 1 (09-01-SUMMARY.md)
- ~~REQUIREMENTS.md REPO-01..06 checkboxes still unchecked~~ — **RESOLVED**: All checked in Phase 9 Plan 1
- **08-02-SUMMARY.md overstates settings sync gap** — push pipeline does handle settings; the manual fix was one-time during rename (minor, cosmetic)

### Cross-Phase
- ~~205 stale `configs/common/` references in `.planning/` docs~~ — **RESOLVED**: Cleaned in Phase 9 Plan 2 (remaining are historical requirement/feature definitions)
- ~~67 stale `~/Repos/agents` references in `.planning/` docs~~ — **RESOLVED**: Cleaned in Phase 9 Plan 2 (remaining are historical requirement/feature definitions)

## Gap Closure Path

All gaps closed. v2.0 milestone shipped.
