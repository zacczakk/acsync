# v2.0 Milestone Audit: Simplify Canonical

**Audited:** 2026-02-24T19:45:00Z
**Status:** gaps_found
**Milestone Goal:** Flatten canonical structure, unify instructions, rename repo — breaking changes for cleaner architecture.

## Executive Summary

The v2.0 milestone code is **functionally complete** — all 24 requirements are verified as wired in the codebase by the integration checker, all 4 E2E flows pass, and 402/402 tests are green. However, **Phase 8 is missing its VERIFICATION.md**, and **REQUIREMENTS.md has 6 unchecked checkboxes** (REPO-01..06). These are process/documentation gaps, not code gaps. Closing them requires running the phase verifier on Phase 8 and updating the REQUIREMENTS.md traceability table.

## Scores

| Category | Score | Detail |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Requirements | 15/24 satisfied | 15 satisfied, 3 partial (TOOL-*), 6 unsatisfied (REPO-*) |
| Phases | 2/3 verified | Phase 6 passed, Phase 7 passed, Phase 8 **unverified** |
| Integration | 24/24 wired | All cross-phase connections verified in code |
| E2E Flows | 4/4 pass | check, push, render, diff all work from any cwd |

## Phase Verification Summary

| Phase | Status | Score | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|-------|
| 6. Flatten Canonical Structure | passed | 5/5 | Re-verified after gap closure |
| 7. Unify Instructions | passed | 7/7 | Clean first-pass verification |
| 8. TOOLS.md + Repo Rename | **UNVERIFIED** | — | No 08-VERIFICATION.md exists |

## 3-Source Requirements Cross-Reference

### Source 1: REQUIREMENTS.md Traceability Table

| Requirement | Phase | Checkbox | Status |
|-------------|-------|----------|--------|
| STRUCT-01..05 | 6 | `[x]` | Complete |
| INST-01..10 | 7 | `[x]` | Complete |
| TOOL-01..03 | 8 | `[x]` | Complete |
| REPO-01..06 | 8 | `[ ]` | **Pending** |

### Source 2: Phase VERIFICATION.md Requirements Tables

| Requirement | Verification | Status |
|-------------|-------------|--------|
| STRUCT-01..05 | 06-VERIFICATION.md | SATISFIED |
| INST-01..10 | 07-VERIFICATION.md | SATISFIED |
| TOOL-01..03 | **No 08-VERIFICATION.md** | MISSING |
| REPO-01..06 | **No 08-VERIFICATION.md** | MISSING |

### Source 3: SUMMARY.md Frontmatter `requirements-completed`

| Summary File | Requirements Claimed |
|-------------|---------------------|
| 06-01-SUMMARY.md | STRUCT-01, STRUCT-02, STRUCT-03, STRUCT-04, STRUCT-05 |
| 06-02-SUMMARY.md | STRUCT-02 |
| 07-01-SUMMARY.md | INST-01..10 |
| 07-02-SUMMARY.md | INST-01, INST-02, INST-03, INST-04 |
| 08-01-SUMMARY.md | TOOL-01, TOOL-02, TOOL-03 |
| 08-02-SUMMARY.md | REPO-01, REPO-02, REPO-03, REPO-04, REPO-05, REPO-06 |

### Cross-Reference Matrix

| REPO-06 | missing | listed | `[ ]` | **unsatisfied** |

**Orphan Detection:** No orphaned requirements. All 24 REQ-IDs from the traceability table are claimed by at least one plan SUMMARY.

## Integration Checker Results

**Score: 24/24 requirements verified as WIRED in codebase**

### Cross-Phase Wiring (5/5 WIRED)

| Integration Point | Status | Key Evidence |
|-------------------|--------|--------------|
| Phase 6 → Phase 7: Path constants → Instructions pipeline | WIRED | `INSTRUCTIONS_DIR` used by `readCanonicalInstructions`, imported by all 4 CLI commands |
| Phase 7 → Phase 8: Unified AGENTS.md → Repo rename paths | WIRED | Zero stale repo refs in source; all targets show `~/Repos/acsync` |
| Phase 6+7+8 → CLI: Full pipeline chain | WIRED | PROJECT_ROOT → path constants → readCanonical* → render → write; zero residual `cwd()` |
| Phase 8: PROJECT_ROOT bun link resolution | WIRED | `import.meta.dir` resolves correctly; `acsync check` works from /tmp |
| Phase 8: Settings sync (opencode.json) | WIRED | Both canonical and target show `instructions: ["~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md"]` |

### E2E Flows (4/4 PASS)

| Flow | Status | Evidence |
|------|--------|----------|
| `acsync check` from any directory | PASS | 54 items shown, correct drift detection |
| `acsync push --force` renders all configs | PASS | Full pipeline: read → render → atomicWrite → manifest |
| `acsync push --type instructions` writes correct files | PASS | CLAUDE.md + AGENTS.md×3 at correct paths; stale files absent |
| `acsync render --type instruction` outputs content | PASS | Identity passthrough confirmed |

## Tech Debt

### Phase 8: TOOLS.md + Repo Rename
- **Missing 08-VERIFICATION.md** — phase was never formally verified by gsd-verifier
- **REQUIREMENTS.md REPO-01..06 checkboxes still unchecked** despite work being complete per SUMMARY
- **08-02-SUMMARY.md overstates settings sync gap** — push pipeline does handle settings; the manual fix was one-time during rename

### Cross-Phase
- **205 stale `configs/common/` references in `.planning/` docs** — historical planning artifacts, not source code; no runtime impact
- **67 stale `~/Repos/agents` references in `.planning/` docs** — historical planning artifacts, not source code; no runtime impact

## Gap Closure Path

The gaps are **process gaps, not code gaps**. All requirements are functionally implemented and verified by the integration checker. To close:

1. **Run gsd-verifier on Phase 8** — creates 08-VERIFICATION.md with formal requirement attestation
2. **Update REQUIREMENTS.md** — check off REPO-01..06 checkboxes
3. **Re-audit** — should flip to `passed` or `tech_debt`
