# Active Plans

1. `active/vsync-alignment/PLAN.md` — vsync patterns + Codex multi-agent TOML integration
2. `active/simplify-canonical/PLAN.md` — flatten configs, unified AGENTS.md, TOOLS.md, repo rename

Execute vsync-alignment first (correctness fixes + Codex agent format). Then simplify-canonical (structure changes).
