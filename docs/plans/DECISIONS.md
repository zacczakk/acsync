# Cross-Plan Decision Log

Decisions that span multiple plans or affect the repo broadly.

| Date | Decision | Context | Status |
|------|----------|---------|--------|
| 2026-02-18 | Migrate `.tasks/` → `docs/plans/` | Align with canonical AGENTS.md structure | Done |
| 2026-02-18 | Agent-driven sync (no build step) | SYNC.md as contract, CLI reads playbook | Superseded — now code-driven via `acsync` CLI |
